This is a major version upgrade that introduces breaking changes.\n\n## New Features\n\n### 1. Enhanced User Profiles\n- **Feature:** Add comprehensive user profile management\n- **Description:** Support for custom fields, profile images, social links, and privacy settings\n- **New endpoints:** \n  - `GET /v2/users/{id}/profile`\n  - `PUT /v2/users/{id}/profile`\n  - `POST /v2/users/{id}/avatar`\n\n### 2. OAuth 2.1 Authentication\n- **Feature:** Upgrade from OAuth 2.0 to OAuth 2.1\n- **Description:** Implement PKCE, remove implicit flow, add device flow\n- **Security Enhancement:** Mandatory HTTPS, improved token security\n- **New endpoints:**\n  - `POST /v2/oauth/device/authorize`\n  - `POST /v2/oauth/device/token`\n\n### 3.

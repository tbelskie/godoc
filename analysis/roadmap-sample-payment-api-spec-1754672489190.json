    "content": "# Payment API Enhancement - Feature Specification\n\n## Overview\nAdd support for recurring billing and subscription management to our existing Payment API. This will enable merchants to set up and manage subscription-based services.\n\n## New Features\n\n### 1. Subscription Creation\n- **Feature:** Add new `POST /subscriptions` endpoint\n- **Description:** Create recurring billing subscriptions with customizable intervals\n- **Integration:** Requires webhook system for payment notifications\n\n### 2. Subscription Management\n- **Feature:** Add subscription lifecycle management endpoints\n- **Description:** Pause, resume, cancel, and modify existing subscriptions\n- **Integration:** Update existing customer dashboard\n\n### 3. Enhanced Authentication\n- **Feature:** OAuth 2.0 token refresh for long-lived subscriptions\n- **Description:** Implement token refresh mechanism for subscriptions that run longer than access token lifetime\n- **Security:** Add subscription-specific scopes and permissions\n\n### 4. Webhook Enhancements\n- **Feature:** Add subscription-specific webhook events\n- **Description:** New events for subscription.created, subscription.payment_failed, subscription.cancelled\n- **Integration:** Existing webhook infrastructure needs updates\n\n## Breaking Changes\n- Deprecate old recurring payment endpoints (/payments/recurring)\n- Update authentication scopes - existing API keys need new permissions\n- Breaking change to webhook payload structure\n\n## Documentation Requirements\nBased on this specification, we need to update:\n- API reference documentation\n- Authentication guides\n- Integration tutorials\n- SDK documentation\n- Error handling guides\n- Migration guide for breaking changes\n\n## Technical Complexity\nThis is a high-complexity change involving:\n- New API endpoints (5+ new endpoints)\n- Database schema changes\n- Webhook infrastructure updates  \n- OAuth 2.0 implementation\n- Breaking changes requiring migration guides\n",

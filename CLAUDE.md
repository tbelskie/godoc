### **CRITICAL: Project Management Requirements** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**UNACCEPTABLE TO DROP THE BALL ON TRACKING AND DOCUMENTING**
- ALWAYS happens, EVERY TIME, NO EXCUSES, NO EXCEPTIONS
- After EVERY sprint/feature completion:
  1. ‚úÖ Update GitHub issues with actual deliverables vs planned
  2. ‚úÖ Close completed issues with comprehensive delivery summaries  
  3. ‚úÖ Update epic/parent issues with progress status
  4. ‚úÖ Commit and push ALL work to repository immediately
  5. ‚úÖ Update CLAUDE.md with new features/commands
  6. ‚úÖ Use TodoWrite to track progress throughout development
- **Never get absorbed in technical work at expense of project management**
- **Sprint 2 lesson**: Built amazing Content Planning Intelligence but forgot to update issues until called out

### **DAILY DEVELOPMENT LOGS** üìù
- **End of EVERY development day**: Create daily log in `daily-dev-logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Git ignored**: Logs are for internal development process only
- **Content**: Everything accomplished, decisions made, blockers encountered, next steps
- **Format**: Structured markdown with consistent sections
- **Purpose**: Maintain development continuity and institutional knowledge

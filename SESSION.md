# Hugo AI Development Session

## Current Status (Last Updated: 2025-08-06)

### ✅ Completed
1. Core architecture implemented
   - Context manager for persistent state
   - Hugo expertise module
   - Claude simulator for MVP
2. CLI commands implemented
   - `init` - Initialize new Hugo sites
   - `generate` - Create content from natural language
   - `analyze` - Comprehensive site analysis
   - `refactor` - Modernize and improve existing sites
3. Documentation created
   - README.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, product-vision.md
   - CLAUDE.md for future Claude instances
4. Git repository initialized with clean history (7 commits)
5. GitHub repository created: https://github.com/tbelskie/hugo-ai
6. Working demo system
   - Automated test script (test-demo.js)
   - Example workflows and usage guide
   - All commands tested and working

### 📋 TODO (Next Session)
1. Add GitHub Actions CI/CD
2. Implement actual Claude API integration (currently using simulator)
3. Add comprehensive test suite with Jest
4. Create more detailed example sites
5. Add performance benchmarking
6. Implement streaming responses for better UX

### 💡 Key Decisions Made
- Using Commander.js for CLI framework
- Context stored in `.hugo-ai/` directory
- Three-tier context management (project/content/technical)
- Simulator pattern for MVP before real API integration

### 🔧 Local Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Link for local testing
npm link

# Test commands
hugo-ai init --describe "API documentation site"
hugo-ai generate --content "Authentication guide"
hugo-ai analyze --performance --seo
```

### 📝 Notes for Next Session
- The refactor command code was written but not saved/committed
- Consider adding streaming responses for better UX
- Need to implement actual Hugo binary checks/installation
- Should add progress persistence for long-running operations

### 🎯 Next Steps Priority
1. Finish and commit refactor command
2. Create at least one working demo
3. Add basic tests
4. Record demo video/screenshots for README

# GOdoc: Solo-to-Scale Business Plan & Timeline

## Executive Summary

**Mission**: Transform docs-as-code workflows from complex, time-consuming processes into conversational AI-assisted automation that saves teams days of work per documentation task.

**Opportunity**: 100,000+ teams globally waste 60-80% of documentation time on process overhead rather than content creation. Current solutions are fragmented, requiring multiple tools and manual coordination.

**Solution**: GOdoc provides conversational docs-as-code workflow orchestration, combining Claude Code AI with Hugo/Jekyll generation, git automation, and deployment management in a single CLI interface with enterprise SaaS features.

**Business Model**: Freemium SaaS with open-source CLI driving bottom-up adoption and enterprise features capturing value ($50-200/user/month).

**Market Size**: $2.75B TAM with realistic $140M serviceable market in early adopter segment.

**Financial Projections**: Path to $100K+ MRR in 24 months, $1M+ ARR by month 30, positioning for $20M-50M exit or continued scaling.

**Founder Advantage**: 10 years technical writing experience, proven AI-assisted development skills, deep understanding of target customer pain points.
